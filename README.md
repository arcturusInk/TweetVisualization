Data Visualization of Tweets regarding Automation
--

Using data from Twitter, I wanted to find out how people feel about "automation" by doing some sentiment analysis on the data. I used the TextBlob library's algorithm for sentiment analysis.

Afterwards, I used the sentiment data to create visuals that can represent how positive or negative the tweets are. Specifically, I created two histograms - one for polarity, another for subjectivity - and a scatter plot graph that compares polarity vs. subjectivity from the dataset. A histogram is a bar graph that shows how many things are in each range of values. A Scatter Plot has points that show the relationship between two sets of data. 

Below are the graphs, I produced:
